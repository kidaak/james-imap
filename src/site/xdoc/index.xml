  <section name="What Is James IMAP?">
   
    <p>A library providing a flexible codec for IMAP, command processors 
       and a sample data access layer.</p>
       
     <p>In combination with a socket layer, and a mailbox persistence, 
         this library can be used to create an IMAP server.</p>

  </section>

  <section name='Status'>

    <p><a href='http://james.apache.org/server/rfclist/imap4/rfc2060.txt'>RFC2060</a> 
       is functionally complete, tested and usable. The data access layer is still 
       under optimization on performance perspectives. Database schema and API changes 
       are susceptible to change.</p>

       Server 2.3.2</a> would require a volunteer.</p>
